When you buy something on the Internet,
or conduct banking transactions
on a financial website, encryption
is very much involved. At least, it had better be.
You can see whether you are using
secure encrypted communications
within your browser, typically by the
presence of a padlock icon
in the URL bar and in the very first
part of the websites address.

When encryption was initially used
for online, browser-based transactions,
it used the SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) protocol.
These days, that technology has
largely been replaced by the
Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol,
which is regarded as more secure.
TLS uses a combination of asymmetric
and symmetric key methods, as did SSL
before it, to complete an e-commerce transaction.
